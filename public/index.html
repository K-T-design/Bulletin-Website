                <h2>Participating in the Weekly Bulletin Challenge</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the official <strong>Catholic Chaplaincy Bulletin Submission Portal</strong>. This platform is designed to foster deeper engagement with our weekly liturgy and community announcements. By participating in "The Mass Code" challenge, students, staff, and community members are invited to read the weekly bulletin more closely, discovering spiritual insights, upcoming events, and the vibrant life of our chaplaincy.</p>
                <p>The weekly bulletin is more than just a list of dates; it is a vital resource for spiritual growth, connecting us to the universal Church and our local campus mission. Whether you are a regular attendee or new to our community, this simple engagement tool helps ensure you stay informed and connected to the pulse of our student ministry.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to transform the simple act of reading announcements into a moment of pause and reflection. Hidden within the text is a key—a word or code—that unlocks not just a fun weekly challenge, but a habit of attentiveness. In a world of digital noise, taking five minutes to read a printed or digital bulletin can be a grounding spiritual practice.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How the Submission Process Works</h2>
                <p>Participating in the weekly challenge is simple, intuitive, and designed to integrate seamlessly into your Sunday routine. Here is a step-by-step guide on how the process works:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Find the Code</h3>
                <p>Each week, a unique "word" or "code" is hidden within the printed or digital bulletin distributed at Sunday Mass. This code is intentionally placed to encourage you to read the entire document. It might be a specific saint's name mentioned in a reflection, a liturgical term relevant to the season (like "Advent" or "Lent"), or a keyword related to the Gospel reading of the day. Reading the bulletin attentively is the key to finding it.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Submit Your Entry</h3>
                <p>Once you have located the code, visit this portal (TheMassCode.com) to submit your entry. Enter your first name, phone number, and the specific code in the designated fields above. We have kept the form minimal—requiring only essential details—to respect your time and privacy. Ensure your phone number is correct, as this is the primary means of contacting you if you are selected as the winner.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Weekly Selection</h3>
                <p>From the pool of correct entries submitted between Sunday and Thursday, one winner is selected. This selection process is handled fairly and transparently, with the aim of encouraging broad participation across our student body. The winner is typically notified by Friday, and rewards often include small tokens of appreciation relevant to student life, such as coffee vouchers or bookstore credits.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Spiritual Engagement & Community Life</h2>
                <p>The University Catholic Chaplaincy exists to serve the spiritual, intellectual, and social needs of students and staff. "The Mass Code" is one of many initiatives aimed at building a cohesive and informed community. By engaging with the bulletin, you are also engaging with the heartbeat of our chaplaincy.</p>
                <p>Through the bulletin, you will discover a wealth of opportunities to deepen your faith and make lasting friendships:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mass & Sacraments:</strong> Stay updated on Daily Mass times, Confession schedules, and Holy Hour Adoration times. The sacramental life is the source and summit of our community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Events:</strong> Don't miss out on student dinners, movie nights, hikes, and community outings. These events are crucial for building a support network during your university years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service & Outreach:</strong> Find opportunities to serve the local community, participate in charitable works, and live out the Gospel message of service to the poor and vulnerable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faith Formation:</strong> Join Bible studies, "Theology on Tap" sessions, and guest speaker events that challenge your intellect and nourish your soul.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We believe that small acts of attention—like reading a bulletin—can lead to greater acts of participation and faith. It starts with a code, but it ends with a community.</p>

                <h2>Submission Rules & Guidelines</h2>
                <p>To ensure fairness and the smooth operation of this weekly activity, please observe the following guidelines. These rules help us manage the high volume of submissions and ensure everyone has a fair chance.</p>
                
                <h3>Submission Window</h3>
                <p>The portal is active for submissions starting from the first Sunday Mass until the following Thursday at midnight. Entries submitted after the Thursday cutoff may not be counted for the current week's selection. This timeline allows our team to process entries and announce the winner before the next Sunday Mass cycle begins.</p>
                
                <h3>One Entry Per Person</h3>
                <p>Please submit only one entry per person per week. Multiple submissions do not increase your chances and may result in disqualification. We value integrity and honesty in this fun community activity. If you have friends who want to participate, encourage them to submit their own entries!</p>
                
                <h3>Privacy & Data Protection</h3>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. The name and phone number you provide are used <em>solely</em> for the purpose of contacting the weekly winner. We do not share your data with third parties, nor do we use it for marketing purposes. This site is built with security in mind, utilizing secure connections and strict data handling protocols to ensure your information remains safe.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
                <p>All students, staff, and community members who attend the Catholic Chaplaincy are welcome to participate. While the activity is primarily focused on student engagement to help them connect with campus ministry, the wider community is encouraged to follow along with the bulletin news and stay informed.</p>
                
                <h3>What if I entered the wrong code?</h3>
                <p>If you realize you submitted an incorrect code, please do not submit a second entry immediately. The system validates codes against the weekly configuration. If you received an "Invalid Code" message, check the bulletin again and retry. If you submitted a code you <em>thought</em> was correct but realized later it wasn't, you may wait for the next week's challenge.</p>
                
                <h3>How will I know if I won?</h3>
                <p>The selected winner will be contacted directly via the phone number provided in the submission form. We typically send a text message or call to arrange the handover of the prize. Winners may also be acknowledged at the following Sunday Mass or in the next bulletin, depending on community preference and privacy wishes.</p>
                
                <h3>Is this portal secure?</h3>
                <p>Yes. The Mass Code portal uses industry-standard encryption (HTTPS) and secure database management to protect your submissions. We prioritize a safe and secure digital environment for our chaplaincy, ensuring that your participation is worry-free.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I submit for previous weeks?</h3>
                <p>No, the portal is configured to only accept codes for the current active week. Once the Thursday deadline passes, the submission window closes until the new bulletin is released on Sunday. This ensures the challenge remains relevant and tied to the current liturgical week.</p>
